            </ul>

            </ul>

            </ul>
        </li>

        <li>Garnish with "Eyelashes":
            <ul>
                <li>After removing the dish from the oven, garnish with fresh basil leaves around the meatball eyeballs to resemble "eyelashes."</li>
            </ul>
        </li>

            <ul>
